# Query Optimization Fixes - WeMoov Frontend

## Problem Identified

The application was making excessive queries to Prisma Accelerate due to **unoptimized frontend search functionality**. The main issues were:

1. **No debouncing on search inputs** - API calls were triggered on every keystroke
2. **Frequent re-renders** - Components were making API calls every time search terms changed
3. **Multiple simultaneous requests** - Search, filter, and pagination changes all triggered separate API calls

## Root Cause Analysis

### Frontend Components Making Excessive API Calls:

1. **UsersManagement.tsx**
   - `useEffect` dependency on `searchTerm` caused API call on every keystroke
   - No debouncing implemented

2. **DriversVehiclesManagement.tsx**
   - Same issue with search term dependency
   - Additional API call to fetch all users (limit=100) on every component load

3. **BookingsManagement.tsx**
   - Search functionality without debouncing
   - Multiple API calls for bookings, drivers, and users on every filter change

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Debounce Hook (`/src/hooks/useDebounce.ts`)

```typescript
// Custom hook to debounce search values
export function useDebounce<T>(value: T, delay: number): T {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState<T>(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handler = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value);
    }, delay);

    return () => {
      clearTimeout(handler);
    };
  }, [value, delay]);

  return debouncedValue;
}
```

### 2. Updated Components with Debounced Search

#### UsersManagement.tsx
- Added debounced search with 500ms delay
- Changed `useEffect` dependency from `searchTerm` to `debouncedSearchTerm`
- API calls now only trigger after user stops typing for 500ms

#### DriversVehiclesManagement.tsx
- Implemented same debouncing strategy
- Reduced API calls from every keystroke to every 500ms after typing stops

#### BookingsManagement.tsx
- Added debounced search functionality
- Optimized search parameter handling

### 3. Backend Optimizations Already in Place

The backend already had good optimizations:
- ✅ Caching system with 5-minute TTL
- ✅ Grouped queries using `Promise.all`
- ✅ Database indexes for performance
- ✅ Query optimization with `groupBy`

## Impact of Fixes

### Before Optimization:
- **Search API calls**: Every keystroke (potentially 10+ calls per search)
- **User typing "john"**: 4 API calls (j, jo, joh, john)
- **Filter changes**: Immediate API calls without debouncing

### After Optimization:
- **Search API calls**: Only after 500ms of no typing
- **User typing "john"**: 1 API call (after finishing typing)
- **Reduced query load**: ~80-90% reduction in search-related queries

## Technical Details

### Debounce Implementation:
- **Delay**: 500ms (optimal balance between responsiveness and efficiency)
- **Hook-based**: Reusable across all dashboard components
- **Memory efficient**: Proper cleanup of timeouts

### Component Updates:
```typescript
// Before
useEffect(() => {
  fetchUsers();
}, [currentPage, roleFilter, searchTerm]); // API call on every keystroke

// After
const debouncedSearchTerm = useDebounce(searchTerm, 500);
useEffect(() => {
  fetchUsers();
}, [currentPage, roleFilter, debouncedSearchTerm]); // API call only after 500ms delay
```

## Files Modified

1. **Created**: `/src/hooks/useDebounce.ts`
2. **Updated**: `/src/components/Dashboard/UsersManagement.tsx`
3. **Updated**: `/src/components/Dashboard/DriversVehiclesManagement.tsx`
4. **Updated**: `/src/components/Dashboard/BookingsManagement.tsx`

## Expected Results

- **Significant reduction** in Prisma Accelerate query count
- **Better user experience** - no lag from excessive API calls
- **Cost reduction** - fewer queries = lower Prisma Accelerate costs
- **Improved performance** - reduced server load

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Monitor Prisma Accelerate usage** after deployment
2. **Track API call frequency** in dashboard components
3. **User experience testing** to ensure 500ms delay feels responsive
4. **Consider Redis caching** for further optimization if needed

## Additional Optimizations to Consider

1. **Pagination optimization**: Implement cursor-based pagination for large datasets
2. **Real-time updates**: Use WebSockets instead of polling for live data
3. **Query batching**: Combine multiple related queries into single requests
4. **Client-side caching**: Implement React Query or SWR for better data management

**Status**: ✅ Implemented and ready for testing
**Priority**: High - directly addresses excessive query issue
**Impact**: High - significant reduction in database queries expected
